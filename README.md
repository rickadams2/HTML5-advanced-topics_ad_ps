In Advanced HTML5 you learn to build native rich internet applications by taking advantage of features that: allow a website to operate with or without internet connectivity, relieve the UI thread of intense processing, reduce application overhead by using Web Sockets for constant communication with the server, extend the amount of data available on the client using the new storage APIs, programmatically locate userâ€™s geographical location on a one-time or continual basis and make data on your website available to both viewers and machines with Microdata markup.
